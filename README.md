# Online Bookstore Rails

A RESTFUL API built with Ruby on Rails.
In this project, I built a fullstack application where users can access books they love, add a book to favorite, and add notes to favorite books. 
The project serves as my final capstone project at Microverse. The repo for the client app can be accessed [here](https://github.com/tGodson/online-bookstore-react)

### Deploy to a live server

Deploying to a live server like Heroku is easy, make sure you have the necessary credentials setup on your local machine

```bash
heroku create

git push heroku $BRANCH_NAME:master 
```
if you are already in master branch no need to add $BRANCH_NAME, just use `git push heroku master`

```bash

heroku run rails db:seed
heroku open
```
